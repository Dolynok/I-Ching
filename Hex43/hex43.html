  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">Kwâi requires (in him who would fulfil its meaning) the exhibition (of the culprit's guilt) in the royal court, and a sincere and earnest appeal (for sympathy</p>
  <p class="judge">and support), with a consciousness of the peril (involved in cutting off the criminal). He should (also) make announcement in his own</p>
  <p class="judge">city, and show that it will not be well to have recourse at once to arms. (In this way) there will be advantage in whatever he shall go forward to.</p>

  <p class="judge">shows its subject in (the pride of) strength advancing with his toes.</p>

  <p class="judge">shows its subject (about to advance) with strong (and determined) looks. There will be evil. </p>
  <p class="judge">(But) the superior man, bent on cutting off (the criminal), will walk alone and encounter the rain, (till he be hated by his proper associates) as</p>
  <p class="judge">if he were contaminated (by the others). (In the end) there will be no blame against him.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fourth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge"> shows one from whose buttocks the skin has been stripped, and who walks slowly and with difficulty. (If he could act) like.</p>
  <p class="judge">a sheep led (after its companions), occasion for repentance would disappear. But though he hear these words, he will not believe them.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows (the small men like) a bed of purslain, which ought to be uprooted with the utmost determination.</p>
  <p class="judge">(The subject of the line having such determination), his action, in harmony with his central position, will lead to no error or blame.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>sixth SIXTH</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject without any (helpers) on whom to call. His end will be evil.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">(Looking at) Žing, (we think of) how (the site of) a town may be changed, while (the fashion of) its</p>
  <p class="judge">wells undergoes no change. (The water of a well) never disappears and never receives (any great) increase, and those who</p>
  <p class="judge">come and those who go can draw and enjoy the benefit. If (the drawing) have nearly been accomplished, but, before the rope has quite reached the water, the bucket is broken, this is evil.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the separate lines by the duke of Kâu</p>
  <p class="judge">The <b>first SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows a well so muddy that men will not drink of it;</p>
  <p class="judge">or an old well to which neither birds (nor other creatures) resort.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows a well from which by a hole the water escapes and flows away to the</p>
  <p class="judge">shrimps (and such small creatures among the grass), or one the water of which leaks away from a broken basket.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>third NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows a well, which has been cleared out, but is not used. Our hearts are sorry for this,</p>
  <p class="judge">for the water might be drawn out and used. If the king were (only) intelligent, both he and we might receive the benefit of it.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fourth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows a well, the lining of which is well laid. There will be no error.</p>


  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge"> shows a clear, limpid well, (the waters from) whose cold spring are (freely) drunk.</p>


  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>topmost SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows (the water from) the well brought to the top, which is not allowed to be covered.</p>
  <p class="judge">This suggests the idea of sincerity. There will be great good fortune.</p>

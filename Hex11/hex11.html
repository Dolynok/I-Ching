  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">In Th&acirc;i the little gone and the great come. (It indicates that) there will </p>
  <p class="judge">be good fortune, with progress and success.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the separate lines by the duke of Kâu</p>
  <p class="judge">The <b>first (or lowest) NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">suggests the idea of grass pulled up, and bringing with it other stalks</p>
  <p class="judge">with whose roots it is connected. Advance (on the part of its subject) will be fortunate.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows one who can bear with the uncultivated, will cross the Ho without a boat,</p>
  <p class="judge">does not forget the distant, and has no (selfish) friendships. Thus does he prove himself</p>
  <p class="judge">acting in accordance with the course of the due Mean.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>third NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows that, while there is no state of peace that is not liable to be disturbed, and</p>
  <p class="judge">and no departure (of evil men) so that they shall not return, yet when one is firm and correct,</p>
  <p class="judge">as he realises the distresses that may arise, he will commit no error.</p>
  <p class="judge">There is no occasion for sadness at the certainty (of such recurring changes);</p>
  <p class="judge">and in this mood the happiness (of the present) may be (long) enjoyed.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fourth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject fluttering (down);--not relying on his own rich resources, but calling in his neighbours.</p>
  <p class="judge">(They all come) not as having received warning, but in the sincerity (of their hearts).</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">reminds us of (king) Tî-yî's (rule about the) marriage of his younger sister.</p>
  <p class="judge">By such a course there is happiness and there will be great good fortune.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>sixth (or topmost) SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows us the city wall returned into the moat. It is not the time to use the army. </p>
  <p class="judge">(The subject of the line) may, indeed, announce his orders to the people of his own city; </p>
  <p class="judge">but however correct and firm he may be, he will have cause for regret.</p>

    <p class="title">the image</p>
    <p class="judge">That which is bright rises twice:</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">L&icirc; indicates that, (in regard to what it denotes), it will be advantageous</p>
  <p class="judge">to be firm and correct, and that thus there will be free course and success. Let</p>
  <p class="judge">(its subject) also nourish (a docility like that of) the cow, and there will be </p>
  <p class="judge">good fortune.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the separate lines by the duke of Kâu</p>
  <p class="judge">The <b>first NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows one ready to move with confused steps. But he treads at the same time reverently,</p>
  <p class="judge">and there will be no mistake.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject in his place in yellow. There will be great good fortune.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>third NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject in a position like that of the declining sun. Instead of</p>
  <p class="judge">playing on his instrument of earthenware, and singing to it, he utters the </p>
  <p class="judge">groans of an old man of eighty. There will be evil.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fourth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows the manner of its subject's coming. How abrupt it is, as with fire,</p>
  <p class="judge"> with death, to be rejected (by all)!</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject as one with tears flowing in torrents, and groaning in</p>
  <p class="judge"> sorrow. There will be good fortune.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>topmost NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows the king employing its subject in his punitive expeditions. Achieving</p>
  <p class="judge"> admirable (merit), he breaks (only) the chiefs (of the rebels). Where his </p>
  <p class="judge">prisoners were not their associates, he does not punish. There will be no error.</p>

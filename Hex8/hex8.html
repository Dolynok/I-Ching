    <p class="judge">Thus the kings of antiquity</p>
    <p class="judge">Bestowed the different states as fiefs</p>
    <p class="judge">And cultivated friendly relations</p>
    <p class="judge">With the feudal lords.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">P&icirc; indicates that (under the conditions which it supposes) there is good fortune.</p>
  <p class="judge"> But let (the principal party intended in it) re-examine himself, (as if) by divination,</p>
  <p class="judge"> whether his virtue be great, unintermitting, and firm. If it be so, there will be no error.</p>
  <p class="judge"> Those who have not rest will then come to him; and with those who are (too) late in coming it will be ill.</p>

</p>
  <p class="title">Explanation of the separate lines by the duke of Kâu</p>
  <p class="judge">The <b>first SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject seeking by his sincerity to win the attachment of his object.</p>
  <p class="judge">Let (the breast) be full of sincerity as an earthenware vessel</p>
  <p class="judge">is of its contents, and it will in the end bring other advantages.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">In the <b>second SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">we see the movement towards union and attachment proceeding from the inward (mind).</p>
  <p class="judge">With firm correctness there will be good fortune.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">In the <b>third SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge"> we see its subject seeking for union with such as ought not to be associated with.</p>

  <p class="judge">In the <b>fourth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">we see its subject.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">affords the most illustrious instance of seeking union and attachment.</p>
  <p class="judge">(We seem to see in it) the king urging his pursuit of the game (only) in three directions, and</p>
  <p class="judge">allowing the escape of all the animals before him, while the people of his towns</p>
  <p class="judge">do not warn one another (to prevent it). There will be good fortune.</p>


  <br>

  <p class="judge">In the <b>topmost SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">we see one seeking union and attachment without having taken the first step (to such an end).</p>
  <p class="judge">There will be evil.</p>

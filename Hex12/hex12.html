  <p class="judge">with whose roots it is connected. With firm correctness (on the part of its subject),</p>
  <p class="judge">there will be good fortune and progress.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject patient and obedient. To the small man (comporting himself so)</p>
  <p class="judge">there will be good fortune. If the great man (comport himself) </p>
  <p class="judge">as the distress and obstruction require, he will have success.</p>

  <p class="judge">In the <b>fifth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>

  <p class="judge">(But let him say), 'We may perish! We may perish!' (so shall the state of things become firm,</p>
  <p class="judge">as if) bound to a clump of bushy mulberry trees</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>sixth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>

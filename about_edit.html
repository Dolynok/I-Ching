  <p class="top" style="font-size: 1.3vw;" align="center">The <i>I Ching</i>, or <i>Book of Changes</i>, is one of the five Confucian classics of
  ancient China. While originally used for fortune-telling, many have written philosophical interpretations of the text over the course of its long
  history. Because of this, the <i>Changes</i> is today regarded primarily as a book of wisdom. It is comprised of multiple layers 
  of text compiled over many centuries, but here we have included only the very oldest parts. These obscure verses, collectively called <i>Zhouyi</i>,
  are what the later, prose-based commentaries elaborate on. On this site we have provided three of the most influential translations of the <i>Zhouyi</i>:
  James Legge's 1882 translation; the 1950 English rendering by Cary F. Baynes of Richard Wilhelm's German translation; and the 2000 translation by 
  Alfred Huang (see "In Western Culture" for more on these selections). Because of the vast differences between the English and Chinese languages, 
  each translation is necessarily limited in its ability to convey the original text's meaning. For each of the 64 hexagrams, we have juxtaposed each author's intepretation, in the hope
  that this will illuminate the meaning of the original Chinese better than an single translation can.<p class="second" style="font-size: 1.3vw;" align="center";>Below we have given a brief overview of the text's history, to better orient the reader.</p>

<center style="font-size:3vw;font-weight:bolder;color:rgb(255,40,40);margin-top:35px;">Origins and Structure</center>
  <p style="font-size: 1.3vw;" align="center;">
	  The <i>I Ching</i> is comprised of the <i>Zhouyi</i>, and a series of commentaries on the text, the Ten Wings. The <i>Zhouyi</i> was written during
	the Western Zhou period (c. 1045/6-771 BCE). While it is unknown who authored it, tradition attributes the different layers of the <i>Zhouyi</i> to 
	a succession of legendary figures. Fu Xi, the mythological creator of man, is said to have derived the trigrams&mdash;eight figures comprised of split and solid lines&mdash;
	from observation of the world. These trigrams were then paired in all possible permutations to create the 64 six-line hexagrams. This was done by King Wen, the
	 legendary founder of the Zhou Dynasty, who is also credited with writing the judgement statements explaining each hexagram. It is debated in the tradition whether
	 Wen or his son, the Duke of Zhou, wrote the stanzas explaining each of the hexagram's lines. The Ten Wings were purportedly written by Confucius (551-479 BCE).</p>


<center style="font-size:3vw;font-weight:bolder;color:rgb(255,40,40);margin-top:35px;">Methods of Consultation</center>
  <p class ="prettyprint" style="font-size: 1.3vw;" align="center">
  The methods of consultation have varied over the course of the <i>Changes</i>' history. Initially, stalks from the yarrow plant were used to derive a hexagram.
	 The original process is unknown, but a method developed by scholar Zhu Xi (1130-1200 BCE) has been favored right up to the present. After a series of preliminary rituals,
	 the stalks would be handled by a priest, who would burn incense, pass a bundle of 50 stalks over the smoke, and in a fomally-worded question would inquire about the 
	situation of the person who has come to the priest for guidance. The priest would then divide up the stalks according to the process, yielding a hexagram that he would then interpret.
	<p class="second" style="font-size: 1.3vw;" align="center";>During the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), a simpler method developed. This entailed throwing three coins six times, to derive 
	each line of the hexagram&mdash;bottom to top&mdash;based on whether the majority landed heads or tails. When two of the three coins land tails up,
	this yields a 7, a solid line. Two coins heads up yield an 8, a split line. Three heads up yield a 9, which also makes a solid. Unlike with 7, however, 
	a solid line from 9 changes into a split line. Likewise with three tails up, yielding a 6, a split line that changes into a solid one. When the coin tosses yield 6 or 9 for any lines, there 
	are then two hexagrams: that formed by the original lines, and that hexagram after the 6's and 9's have changed. The reading consists of the judgement and image stanzas for the original hexagram,
	 the stanzas corresponding to the changing lines, and the judgement and image stanzas for the changed hexagram.</p>

  <p class ="prettyprint" style="font-size: 1.3vw;" align="center">
  The first translators of the <i>I Ching</i> into Western languages were a group of Jesuit scholars working in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. These men, the Figurists, believed 
	  the text had originally been brought to China by Shem, the son of Noah, after the great flood described in Genesis. The Figurists were eventually followed by Protestant missionaries who
	   came to China in the late 19th century. Like the Jesuits before them, most of the missionary translators skewed the meaning of the <i>Changes</i> in their search for Christian themes in the text. Scotsman James Legge was the 
	  exception. The translation he published in 1882 is the first to treat the text as a product of its own culture.<p class="second" style="font-size: 1.3vw;" align="center";>Many translations of merit 
	have since been written. Perhaps the most influential is that written by German missionary Richard Wilhelm. Unlike previous translators who addressed an academic audience, WilhelPublished in 1923, the translation was rendered into English by Cary F. Baynes, a student of famed Swiss psyhcoanalyst
	 Carl-Gustav Jung, in 1950. Jung, a close friend of Wilhelm, wrote a foreword to the English edition that explained the <i>Changes</i> in terms of his "acausal connecting principle," synchronicity. This foreword 
	and Wilhelm's reader-friendly style helped the translation gain a wide readership among the spiritual seekers of the 1960s counterculture of the United States and United Kingdom. Among the new users of the <i>Changes</i> were some very 
	iconic figures, including composer John Cage, sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, and songwriter Bob Dylan.<p class="second" style="font-size: 1.3vw;" align="center";> The most recent translation included on the site 
	is that by Taoist Master Alfred Huang in 2000. Born in China in 1921, Huang studied the <i>I Ching</i> before being imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. Huang claims that during his 22-year confinement, 
	the wisdom of the <i>Changes</i> gave him the strength to endure. Huang is the only translator we have included who is a native Chinese speaker.

  The I Ching (pronounced “eye ching”), or Book of Changes is one of the five canonical Confucian Classics, and one of the oldest books still used
  today. Originally, it was used for divination, though for much of its existence it has primarily been considered to be a book of wisdom, with many
  commentaries attaching philosophical meanings to the text. On this site, we have provided three notable English translations of the text of each
  of the book’s 64 hexagrams, without the commentaries typically attached. Given the vast differences between English and Chinese, any given single
  translation will inevitably distort the meaning. The inclusion of three different translations is meant to illuminate the original meaning of the
  text better than any single translation can.</pre>

  Below we have provided some general background information about the history of the text. For more information about the I Ching, see our

  <pre style="font-size:1.3vw;">
  The I Ching (pronounced 'eye ching'), or Book of Changes, is one of the five canonical Confucian Classics, and one of the oldest books
  still used today. Originally, it was used for divination, though for much of its existence it has primarily been considered to be a book of
  wisdom, with many commentaries attaching philosophical meanings to the text. It is comprised of two main parts, the Zhouyi, and the Ten Wings.</pre>
  <pre style="font-size:1.3vw;">
  The Zhouyi is the older part of the work, composed in China during its Bronze Age, and compiled during the Western Zhou period (ca. 1045/6
  -771 BCE). It consists only of the 64 hexagrams. Hexagrams are symbols composed of six lines, each line being either solid or divided in half.
  Each hexagram is a combination of two trigrams, or three-line symbols composed of solid and broken lines. The eight trigrams that can be produced
  by combinations of solid and broken lines are traditionally said to have been derived from nature by the mythological ancient ruler Fu Xi. The
  Ten Wings were composed late in the Warring States period (5th century BCE - 221 BCE), or early in the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 AD). King Wen,
  ancestor of the ruling family of the Zhou dynasty, is traditionally said to have written the 'judgement texts', short explanations of each
  hexagram. His son, the Duke of Zhou, is said to have written the interpretations of each line of the judgement text, and Confucius is credited
  with writing or collecting the canonical commentaries on each hexagram. Today none of these attributions are considered to be correct; the actual
  authors are unknown.</pre>
  <pre style="font-size:1.3vw;">
  The Book of Changes is called this because each hexagram is meant to represent a state of change. Accordingly, different hexagrams have specifc
  corresponding hexagrams that follow them, representing the possible states that can follow a given situation.This idea that everything changes
  in sequence is central to understanding the I Ching.</pre>

<center style="font-size:3vw;font-weight:bolder;color:rgb(255,40,40);">Methods of Consultation</center>
  <pre style="font-size:1.3vw;">
  The exact methods through which people have consulted the I Ching have changed through the course of its existence. Originally yarrow stalks
  were used to derive the hexagrams, though the original method is no longer known. An alternative method employing yarrow stalks, however, was
  developed during the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) by the scholar Zhu Xi that is still used today. A fortune teller would, after a series of
  preliminary rituals, burn incense, pass a bundle of fifty milfoil stalks over the smoke, and address the stalks with a formal inquiry into the
  matter about which the person seeking guidance has come to the fortune teller. After this, the stalks would be divided up by a complex process
  to yield the six lines of the hexagram. The fortune teller or an interpreter would then attach meaning to the hexagram so that it would appear
  relevant the the situation the client is inquiring about. A more popular method developed during the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907) is the use of coins.
  This method is essentially six heads-or-tails throws determining whether each line will be broken or solid. Alternative methods such as special
  dice, and, more recently, computer programs, have since been developed.</pre>

<center style="font-size:3vw;font-weight:bolder;color:rgb(255,40,40);">In Western Culture</center>
  <pre style="font-size:1.3vw;">
  Many English translations of the I Ching have been produced, the earliest being created in the 19th century. The first notable translation
  is that produced by James Legge, a Christian missionary to China, in 1882. While not the first translation, Legge’s is considered to be the first
  accurate, useable one, as earlier Protestant missionary translators did not respect the cultural value of the text. Despite this, Legge’s
  translation never achieved widespread popularity.</pre>
  <pre style="font-size:1.3vw;">
  The I Ching became popular in the West with Richard Wilhelm’s 1923 translation of the book into German, brought into English by Cary F.
  Baynes in 1949. Wilhelm presented the books as a nontheistic spiritual text, and one that spoke to the depths of one’s “unconscious spheres”.
  Swiss psychologist Carl Jung’s foreword to Wilhelm’s translation expanded on this. Jung wrote of the I Ching as a profound system of symbols to
  be used for self-development. He related I Ching consultation to his concept of synchronicity, which he described as an “acausal connecting
  principle”, writing that when someone consults the book, while the selection of a hexagram occurs by chance, the hexagram arrived at can appear
  relevant to the user’s situation, and can help provide insight regarding how to proceed.</pre>
  <pre style="font-size:1.3vw;">
  Wilhelm and Jung’s characterization of the I Ching as a practical guide for everyday use rather than an ancient text for academic study made
  it seem more accessible to a much broader audience. During the counter-cultural revolution of the 1960s, the book became much revered by
  westerners interested in Eastern spirituality. Among the new users were some very iconic figures of the counter-culture, who no doubt helped
  further increase its popularity. John Cage, for example, seeking systematic ways to create musical and visual compositions by chance, created
  charts that equated each hexagram with a certain technique. Science fiction author Philip K. Dick, who used the I Ching as a personal guide for
  much of his life, employed the book in writing his novel The Man in the High Castle. Various characters in the novel consulted the book to make
  decisions. The hexagrams they came upon were those thrown by Dick using the traditional coin method of consultation, and they would determine for
  him what the characters would do next. Wilhelm and Baynes’ I Ching was also used by Bob Dylan, Allen Ginsberg, and George Harrison, among other
  influential figures. As you can see, the reach of the Wilhelm-Baynes’ translation was broad, and it had a substantial influence on the American
  counterculture.</pre>
  <pre style="font-size:1.3vw;">
  Many notable translations into English have been produced since the Wilhelm-Baynes translation, including those published by John Blofield in
  1968, Richard Rutt in 1996, and Alfred Huang in 1998. The Huang translation is included on this site, and is the only translation here translated
  by someone for whom Chinese is their first language.</pre>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fourth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject (at a feast), with (simply) a bottle of spirits, and a</p>
  <p class="judge">subsidiary basket of rice, while (the cups and bowls) are (only) of earthenware.</p>
  <p class="judge"> He introduces his important lessons (as his ruler's) intelligence admits. There</p>
  <p class="judge"> will in the end be no error.</p>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows the water of the defile not yet full, (so that it might flow away); but</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>topmost SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject bound with cords of three strands or two strands, and placed </p>

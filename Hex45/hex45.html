  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">In (the state denoted by) Žhui, the king will repair to his ancestral temple. It will be advantageous</p>
  <p class="judge">(also) to meet with the great man; and then there will be progress and success, though the advantage must</p>

  <p class="judge">The <b>first SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject with a sincere desire (for union), but unable to carry it out, so that disorder is</p>
  <p class="judge">brought into the sphere of his union. If he cry out (for help to his proper correlate), all at once (his tears) will give place</p>
  <p class="judge">to smiles. He need not mind (the temporary difficulty); as he goes forward, there will be no error.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject led forward (by his correlate). There will be good fortune, and freedom from error.</p>
  <p class="judge">There is entire sincerity, and in that case (even the small offerings of) the vernal sacrifice are acceptable.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>third SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject striving after union and seeming to sigh, yet nowhere finding any advantage.</p>
  <p class="judge">If he go forward, he will not err, though there may be some small cause for regret.</p>

  <p class="judge">shows its subject in such a state that, if he be greatly fortunate, he will receive no blame.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows the union (of all) under its subject in the place of dignity. There will be no error.</p>
  <p class="judge">If any do not have confidence in him, let him see to it that (his virtue) be</p>
  <p class="judge">great, long-continued, and firmly correct, and all occasion for repentance will disappear.</p>

    <p class="judge">Thus in fear and trembling</p>
    <p class="judge">The superior man sets his life in order</p>

    <p class="judge">Good fortune.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="judge">Nine in the <b>second place</b> means:</p>
    <p class="judge">Shock comes bringing danger.</p>
    <p class="judge">A hundred thousand times</p>
    <p class="judge">You lose your treasures</p>

    <p class="judge">Do not go in pursuit of them.</p>
    <p class="judge">After seven days you will get them back again.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="judge">Six in the <b>third place</b> means:</p>
    <p class="judge">Shock comes and makes one distraught.</p>
    <p class="judge">If shock spurs to action</p>
    <p class="judge">One remains free of misfortune.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">Kăn gives the intimation of ease and development. When (the time of) movement (which it indicates) comes, (the subject of the hexagram)</p>
<p class="judge"> will be found looking out with apprehension, and yet miling and talking cheerfully. When the movement (like a crash of thunder) terrifies all within a hundred lî,</p>
  <p class="judge">he will be (like the sincere worshipper) who is not (startled into) letting go his ladle and (cup of) sacrificial spirits.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the separate lines by the duke of Kâu</p>
  <p class="judge">The <b>first NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject, when the movement approaches, looking out and around with apprehension,</p>
  <p class="judge">and afterwards smiling and talking cheerfully. There will be good fortune.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge"> shows its subject, when the movement approaches, in a position of peril. He judges it better to let go the articles (in his possession), and to</p>
  <p class="judge">ascend a very lofty height. There is no occasion for him to pursue after (the things he has let go); in seven days he will find them.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>third SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject distraught amid the startling movements going on.</p>
  <p class="judge">If those movements excite him to (right) action, there will be no mistake.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fourth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject, amid the startling movements, supinely sinking (deeper) in the mud.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject going and coming amidst the startling movements (of the time), and always in peril;</p>
  <p class="judge">but perhaps he will not incur loss, and find business (which he can accomplish).</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>sixth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject, amidst the startling movements (of the time), in breathless dismay and looking round him with trembling apprehension.</p>
  <p class="judge">If he take action, there will be evil. If, while the startling movements have not</p>
  <p class="judge">reached his own person and his neighbourhood, (he were to take precautions), there would be no</p>
  <p class="judge">error, though his relatives might (still) speak against him.</p>

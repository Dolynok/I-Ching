  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">
Khwei indicates that, (notwithstanding the condition of things which it denotes), in small matters there will (still) be good success.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the separate lines by the duke of Kâu</p>
  <p class="judge">The <b>first NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows that (to its subject) occasion for repentance will disappear. He has lost his horses, but</p>
  <p class="judge">let him not seek for them;--they will return of themselves. Should he meet with bad men, he will not err (in communicating with them).</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject happening to meet with his lord in a bye-passage. There will be no error.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>third SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">we see one whose carriage is dragged back, while the oxen in it are pushed back, and he is</p>
  <p class="judge">himself subjected to the shaving of his head and the cutting off of his nose. There is no good beginning, but there will be a good end.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The<b>fourth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">(shows its subject solitary amidst the (prevailing) disunion. (But) he meets</p>
  <p class="judge">with the good man (represented by the first line), and they blend their sincere desires together. The position is one of peril, but there will be no mistake.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows that (to its subject) occasion for repentance will disappear. With his relative</p>
  <p class="judge">(and minister he unites closely and readily) as if he were biting through a</p>
  <p class="judge">piece of skin. When he goes forward (with this help), what error can there be?</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The<b>topmost NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject solitary amidst the (prevailing) disunion. (In the subject of the third line, he seems to) see a pig</p>
  <p class="judge">bearing on its back a load of mud, (or fancies) there is a carriage full of ghosts.</p>
  <p class="judge">He first bends his bow against him, and afterwards unbends it, (for he discovers) that he is not an assailant to injure, but </p>
  <p class="judge">a near relative. Going forward, he shall meet with (genial) rain, and there will be good fortune.</p>
